# 100 Days of Code - A Complete Guide For Beginners and Experienced (remake for C programming language)

> Learning to code without actual coding is like trying to acquire knowledge by just watching a movie.

This challenges originally based on [Geeks For Geeks - 100 Days of Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/) which design for everyone to enhance developing experience.

I will not repeat the content of 100 Days of Code, I just link all the exercises day by day in this document.
