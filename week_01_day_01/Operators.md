# Operators

Operators are the foundation of any programming language.

Thus the functionality of C language is incomplete without the use of operators. Operators allow us to perform different kinds of operations on operands.

In C, operators can be categorized in following categories:

* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, post-increment, pre-increment, post-decrement, pre-decrement
* Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
* Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `>>`, `<<`
* Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc...
* Other operators: conditional, comma, sizeof, address, redirection

| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Unary operator   | `++`, `--`                        | Unary operator                  |
| Binary operator  | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`           | Arithmetic operator             |
|                  | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  | Relational operator             |
|                  | `&&`, `||`, `!`                   | Logical operator                |
|                  | `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `>>`, `<<`    | Bitwise operator                |
|                  | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` | Assignment operator             |
| Ternary operator | `?:`                              | Ternary or conditional operator |
